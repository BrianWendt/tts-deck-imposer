This tool allows you to easily merge your cards (saved as images) into an image file(s) ready to use in TabletopSimulator.
## Notes
This tool is a free browser application hosted on GitHub IO. If you have problems, you should submit an issue ticket here on GitHub. Also use "issue" tickets to make suggestions.

**For best results** I recommend the following:
* Use PNG
* All images should have the exact same dimensions
* Use Chrome or Firefox
